# Turtling.
Repository of Minecraft ComputerCraft Turtle scripts.

## What
The Minecraft mod "ComputerCraft" adds Turtles, which are small robots
with a simple but powerful API. They can be programmed in Lua. This is
a collection of Turtle programs.

See: [http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle]

## Why
The built-in Turtle API is fairly limited. This adds some more advanced
logic to keep track of the Turtle's position, so it can navigate the
world less blindly. This enables the addition of some much nicer
controls, such as a `moveTo(x,y,z)` function that operates relative to
the Turtle's starting position.
